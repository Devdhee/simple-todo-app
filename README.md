# To-Do App

A simple and minimalistic to-do app built with **React** that allows users to create, delete, and manage tasks. The app stores the to-dos in **local storage** so that they persist across browser sessions. Users are also notified of successful operations (like adding or deleting a to-do) with **toast notifications**.

## Features

- **Add To-Do:** Add a new task with ease.
- **Delete To-Do:** Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved in local storage, so they are retained even after closing the browser.
- **Toast Notifications:** Visual feedback for successful operations (e.g., task added, task deleted).
